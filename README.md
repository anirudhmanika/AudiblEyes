The AudiblEyes device is a lightweight, cost-effective, and user-friendly assistive technology designed to address the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals. It combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with environmental analysis to provide real-time audible feedback, empowering users to navigate their surroundings with greater confidence. The solution integrates cutting-edge software and thoughtfully engineered hardware to deliver a practical and effective assistive device tailored to the needs of individuals like the client, Suzanne Erb.
The hardware design emphasizes comfort and usability. The glasses feature a durable, lightweight frame made from 3D-printed PLA, weighing less than 200 grams for extended wear without causing discomfort. To minimize the weight borne by the glasses, the battery is housed in a separate enclosure, connected to the glasses via a flexible cable. The processing unit itself is a Raspberry Pi 5 mounted to the left side of the device frame. A 5MP camera mounted on the frame captures images for processing, and two tactile buttons provide an intuitive user interface for text recognition and playback control. The device is powered by an external battery pack with a capacity of 5000mAh, providing at least eight hours of continuous operation. Figures 10.1 to 10.5 in the Appendix illustrate the design, highlighting key features like camera placement and button configurations.
The software integrates multiple components to achieve seamless functionality. When Button 1 is pressed briefly, the device captures an image and performs OCR using the Google Vision API, converting text into speech. A long press of Button 1 activates both OCR and environmental analysis, using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model to generate a meaningful two-sentence description of the scene. Button 2 controls playback, allowing users to repeat the last spoken output at normal or slower speeds. These processes are outlined in the software flowchart in Figure 8.1 of the Appendix, illustrating how the system manages button inputs, image capture, and text-to-speech output efficiently.
AudiblEyes is both feasible and complete. Rigorous testing confirmed that the device meets its key design specifications. OCR accuracy exceeded 90% under diverse lighting conditions, and environmental analysis provided reliable scene descriptions within 10 seconds of image capture. The device passed structural durability tests, withstanding drops from 1.5 meters onto concrete without damage. Validation testing with users highlighted the comfort and accessibility of the design, with usability scores consistently above 4.0 on a 5-point scale. These results demonstrate that AudiblEyes is ready for real-world application, addressing the primary challenges of text recognition and environmental awareness for visually impaired individuals.
Ultimately, AudiblEyes solves the problem it set out to address by providing an affordable, accessible, and reliable solution for visually impaired users. By combining advanced technology with user-centric design, the device empowers users to interact with their environments more confidently. While features like adjustable volume controls and mobile integration were excluded due to project constraints, they represent potential areas for future development. The AudiblEyes device is a promising step forward in assistive technology, offering a practical and transformative tool for users.
